ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

 * Project
   ijkplayer-java:C:\Users\yong\Desktop\Player\ijkplayer\android\ijkplayer\ijkpl
   ayer-java\src\main\.classpath:
   Could not resolve source path src in project ijkplayer-java: ignored. The
   project may not compile if the given source path provided source code.


Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => ijkplayerjava\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* java\ => ijkplayerjava\src\main\java\
* res\ => ijkplayerjava\src\main\res\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
